# **Ticket to Tech**<br>
**Group members:** Makenzie Kadjeski, Carrie Houston, Jeny Thomas

**Purpose:** This project compares the amount of time it takes for several different path planning algorithms- Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A* Search, and Bidirectional Search- to find the shortest path between two given vertices. This program receives user input as the start and end point, prints the path taken, and the time it took to compute that path. Our data is based off of the buildings at Tennessee Tech and their relative locations to each other.
